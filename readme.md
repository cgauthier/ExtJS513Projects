Live Link: http://www.claudegauthier.net/demos/StateManager513

The purpose of this app is to evolve a comprehensive state management system which will handle static and dynamic components within an ExtJS application

Note that I'm also developing in parallel the same app in the ExtJS 6.2.0 GPL Demos repo


### What's done

1.  border layout is stateful
2.  tabs are stateful
3.  grid columns width and position are stateful
4.	getting data to be stateful in form fields
5.	refactored the project so that it is easier to manage and extend (12/11/2016)

### To do

5.	having dynamic panels added and become stateful
6.	state should only be save and restore on-demand
7.  set up a server side provider to store to the server
8.	keep several versions of state to save and restore on demand
