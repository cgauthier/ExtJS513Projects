# ExtJS 5.1.3 GPL Demos

-	I'm using Sencha Cmd 6.2.1.29 for building these demo apps
-	The projects under located under the demos directory and are using the ExtJS 5.1.3 framework

Note: Currently there are only 1 project within this repo 

-  demos/statemanager - http://www.claudegauthier.net/demos/StateManager513


## demos/statemanager

Live Link: http://www.claudegauthier.net/demos/StateManager513

The purpose of this app is to evolve a comprehensive state management system which will handle static and dynamic components within an ExtJS application

Note that I'm also developing in parallel the same app in the ExtJS 6.2.0 GPL Demos repo

### What's done

1.  border layout is stateful
2.  tabs are stateful
3.  grid columns width and position are stateful
4.	getting data to be stateful in form fields
5.	refactored the project so that it is easier to manage and extend (12/11/2016)

### In Progress

6.	state should only be save and restore on-demand
	- I've got a custom state provider based on localstorage setup, the scaffolding required I do a little bit of rejig of how the app launches itself
	

### To do

5.	having dynamic panels added and become stateful
7.  set up a server side provider to store to the server
8.	keep several versions of state to save and restore on demand
